     	“Derivative Works” shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived 
     	from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications 
     	represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works 
     	shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the 
     	Work and Derivative Works thereof.

     	“Legal Entity” shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities that control, are controlled by, 
     	or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, “control” means (i) the

     	application; or (ii) use by any charitable organization, educational institution, public research organization, 
     	public safety or health organization, environmental protection organization or government institution, in each 
     	case as reasonably determined by Red Date in its sole discretion.

     	License, including the software, application, source code, documentation and any other documents in this 
     	repository, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work, an example of which 
     	is set out in the Appendix below.

     	“You” or “Your” shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.

     2.	THE LICENSOR. You acknowledge and agree that Red Date (or Red Date’s licensors) is the Licensor who 
     	owns all legal right, title and interest in and to the Work, including any intellectual property rights which 
     	subsist in the Work (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those 
     	rights may exist), whether in Source or Object form.

     3.	GRANT OF COPYRIGHT LICENSE FOR SPECIFIED PURPOSES. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, 
     	each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
     	non-transferable, non-sublicensable copyright license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, publish, 
     	copy the Work solely for (i) the BSN Spartan Network project or (ii) Non-Commercial Use.

     4.	GRANT OF PATENT LICENSE. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby 
     	grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, non-transferable, non-sublicensable
     	patent license to make, have made, use, and otherwise transfer the Work solely for the BSN Spartan Network project 
     	or Non-Commercial Use, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that 
     	are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work 
     	to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a 
     	cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work 
     	constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License 
     	for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. 

     5.	REDISTRIBUTION. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any 
     	medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following 
     	conditions:

      	(i)   You must conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice in the 
              form set out in the Appendix below. 

      	(ii)  The Work or Derivative Works must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a 
              relevant date.

      	(iii) The Work or Derivative Works must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License.

      	(iv)  You must license the entire Work or Derivative Works, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes 
              into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply to the whole of the Work or Derivative Works, and 
              all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the Work or 
              Derivative Works in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

      	(v)   If the Work or Derivative Works has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices.

      	(vi)  You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, 
              trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not 
	      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

      	(vii) If the Work includes a “NOTICE” text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that 
              You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, 
              excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following 
              places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, 
              if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever 
              such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do 
              not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside 
              or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot 
              be construed as modifying the License.

     	For the purpose of this Section, an interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent 
	that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice in 
	the form set out in the Appendix below, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the Work (except to the 
	extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the Work under this License, and how to view a copy 
	of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in 
	the list meets this criterion.

     	A compilation of a covered Work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions 
	of the Work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or 
	distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit 
	the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered 
	Work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

     6.	SUBMISSION OF CONTRIBUTIONS. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion 
     	in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or 
     	conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you 
     	may have executed with the Licensor regarding such Contributions.

     7.	TRADEMARKS. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names 
     	of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing 
     	the content of the “NOTICE” file.

     8.	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work on an “AS IS” BASIS, 
     	WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions 
     	of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the 
     	appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

     9.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, 
     	unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
     	liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as 
     	a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, 
     	work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been 
     	advised of the possibility of such damages.

     10.ACCEPTING WARRANTY OR ADDITIONAL LIABILITY. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, 
     	and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this 
     	License provided that, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, 
     	and that You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, 
     	such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

									Appendix

     HOW TO APPLY THE SPARTAN LICENSE TO YOUR WORK

     Include a copy of the Spartan License, typically in a file called LICENSE, in your work, and consider also including a NOTICE file that 
     references the License.

     To apply the Spartan License to specific files in your work, attach the following boilerplate declaration, replacing the fields 
     enclosed by square brackets “[ ]” with your own identifying information. (Don't include the brackets!) Enclose the text in the 
     appropriate comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that you include a file or class name and description of purpose 
     on the same “printed page” as the copyright notice for easier identification within third-party archives.
