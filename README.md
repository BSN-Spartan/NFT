# Spartan-NFT | contract

This document is a guide about the official NFT contract of the spartan network.

## Overview

Spartan-NFT contract contains ERC721 contract and ERC1155 contract.

The ERC721 contract is based on the Ethereum `eip-721` standard. The interface {IERC721} implements all the core functions required for compliance implementation, and has been extended to provide more comprehensive functions such as mint. {ERC721} fully implements {IERC721} interface. (eip-721 referrence: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)

The ERC1155 contract is based on the Ethereum `eip-1155` standard, {ERC1155} implements all the functions provided by the {IERC1155} interface, and provides more convenient functions such as batch generation. (eip-721 reference: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155)

Spartan-NFT contract applies the ERC1967 Proxy contractï¼ŒThis contract implements an upgradable proxy. It is upgradable because the call is delegated to the implementation address which can be changed. The address is stored in storage at the location specified by `eip1967`.
